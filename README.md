<h><b>GoLang</b></h>
This repository is created to learn go lang from scratch

<h><b>Multi-Core Concurrency Support</b></h>

- Go has built in concurrency mechanism, languages like python, nodejs do not have built in concurrency.
- Go was designed to run on multiplee cores and built to support concurrency
- Concurrency in Go is cheap and easy

<h><b>Main Use Cases of GO</b></h>:
 
- For performant applications
- Running on scaled, distributed systems

<h><b> Characteristics of GO</b></h>:

- Simple and readable syntax of a synamically typed language like Python
- Speed and efficiency of a lower-level, statically typed language like C++
- Server-side or Backend language
- Could be used to build microservices, web-applications, database services
- Many cloud technologies or technologies that run on Modern cloud environments are written in Go like Docker, Kubernetes, Cockroach DB and so on.
- Simple Syntax: Easy to learn, read and write code.
- Fast Build Time, startup and run.
- Requires fewer resources like CPU and RAM to run
- A program can only have 1 main function, becasue you can only have 1 entrypoint

<h><b>GO PACKAGES</b></h>

- Go programs are organized into pacgkages
- Go's standard library, provides different core packages for us to use
- "fmt" is one of these, which you can use by importing it
- Check the documentation for identifying the right package
